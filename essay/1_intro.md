<h2>Streaming data</h2>

</br>
So someone has some source of information, and it generates information constantly.

You need that information.

But you can't just wait for it to acumulate, in a simple database and then use that, because it has no end.

It just apears, continuously. like your instagram feed

[wikipedia advises that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_data):
    
    Such data should be processed incrementally
    using stream processing techniques without having access to all
    of the data.
